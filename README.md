# Final-Project

## Pawesome Pups

The Pawesome Pups project was created by Andrea Chen, Chodenla Sherpa, Guenne Sarmiento, and Paulina Gonzalez. Our mission is to provide an educational game that teaches potential future dog owners how to care for their pets properly. In addition, the website provides additional information about popular breeds and donation websites. Also, we incorporated the Google API in order to locate certain dog shelters in the Bay Area in hopes that users will help these dogs by bringing them to a loving home.
