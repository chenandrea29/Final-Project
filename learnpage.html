        The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a cattle herding dog breed<br>which originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales. It is one of<br>two breeds known as a Welsh Corgi. These dogs were used <br>to work cattle, and because of their size, could nip at the<br>livestock's heels while avoiding being kicked. This trait became<br>particularly valuable to working Welshcrofters (farmers) when <br> the British Crown decreed that they could own and work only<br>a few acres that surrounded their farms.

        According to an Encyclopedia Britannica article, the bulldog breed<br>developed in the early 13th century to fight bulls. The English Bulldog<br>descended from ancient mastiffs that originated in Asia and were<br>brought to Europe. Mastiffs were bred for ferocity in fighting,<br>holding, or bringing down aggressive prey.

        The Siberian Husky, Samoyed, and Alaskan Malamute <br>are all breeds directly descended from the original sled <br>dog. It is thought that the term "husky" is a corruption of<br>the nickname "Esky" once applied to the Eskimo<br>and subsequently to their dogs.

        Pomeranians originated from Poland and Germany. The Pomeranian<br> was originally bred as a large sled dog in the 16th century,<br>but was reduced in size through breeding sometime in the<br>19th century. Perhaps this is why the breed often has a personality<br> that resembles one of a large dog. A member of the toy <br>group, the Pomeranian remains a popular companion dog today.
